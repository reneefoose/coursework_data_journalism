## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#The goal of this data project is to compare opioid pills sent to geographical attendance areas of both high and low performing school districts in Maryland and to compare student outcomes -- performance of math and reading on fourth grade students.  A second analysis will be to introudce teacher level experience for each school in the geographical area to determine if the level (years of experience and degree 'bachelor or masters').  The latter analysis would be a first glance review for deeper analysis potentially in a different study.
